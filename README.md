# Description
**clean.sh** is a bash file which cleans up Debian and Ubuntu-based distros disk by just removing old snaps and some non used dependencies.
It is easy to just automate this cleaning process than typing all the command simultaneously.


# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ricktor0/clean_disk.git
cd clean_disk
chmod +x clean.sh
bash clean.sh 
```
